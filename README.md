# Splitit App - User Story SCRUM 6 -- Sketch / proof-of-concept Calculator Feature

///////////////////////////////////

#### EDIT: Code was recently updated (18/10/24) but not README
* new types were created for better readability
* comments were added across the code as an effort to help other team members to understand the implementation
* deleted some unused features
* new function (`__newContrAndSumSpltFunc`) was added to reduce redundancy
* some local variables were moved to global scope to facilitate handling - hack -
* a few changes to style to be even more in sync with MVP

Observations:
- The code use functions that update stateful global-scope containers
- Functions are still not completely agnostic, and therefore can not be decoupled from their sources
- To decouple the functions, one thing that should be done is to evaluate the mechanics of how to get the entering ids, which it is currently set to only responding to my implementation - a string split of rowIds; this can be easily changed

////////////////////////////////////

In this branch you will find an unfinished sketch of a proof-of-concept calculator utility as discussed by the team on a meeting back to the second week of Sept-2024. The file can be found as a single [index.html under the `sketchcalc` folder of this branch](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v51-tier2-team-23/tree/sketchcalc/sketchcalc/index.html) and [corresponding JS and CSS files under `resources` folder of this branch](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v51-tier2-team-23/tree/sketchcalc/resources).

The sketch was under **User Story "SCRUM 6"** of our Jira backlog.

> This branch focus only on the calculator feature. To see the actual implementation please visit our [development branch](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v51-tier2-team-23/tree/development).

The intention of the sketch was to make a first evaluation of the technical requirements of the thought User Story and draw a quick-and-dirty tool that allowed us to identify what was feasible and viable in the time left.

This development began during the fourth Sprint and was on the way to a cleaner proposal so it could be shown to the rest of the group for further discussion before suddenly having to stop further development due to personal circunstances.

## What the plan was

Based on team discussions, the US SCRUM 6 should consist on a split calculator that should work as follow:
* It could split evenly the contributions either using relative - percentage - split or absolute contribution; it can also recalculate for updates in payments
* It would have allowed the editing of more than one Participant

A gif (1min per repeat) of the project can be seen bellow:

In the example above, you can see that:
1. All split defaults to even split of 10000 between 4 Participants at loading
2. Edits of different columns and Participants are made at different moments
3. Updates of the all table are made accordingly

## How the code looked like

As previously mentioned, the development of the User Story was left as a raw HTML / TS code as it was meant to explore the realization of a more functional project.

In general, at its highest scope the code is organized as shown bellow:

![](/resources/img/globalVarAndActions.svg)

A much simple explanation of each of the functionalities in a form of tasks could have been:

### `populateFunc` function

Always default to:

> take the total allotment (a global hardcoded value), populate the table, count the number of "participants" and split the contributions evenly between them (absolute as well as percentages).

The following flow diagram provides more details about the code:

### `editBtnFunc` function

> Make editable the cells of the table based on the user's selection of a column (in this sketch only available for the absolute contributions column), and the "participants".

The following flow diagram provides more details about the code:

### `updateBtnFunc` function

> Once the user has inputed either new (absolute / relative) contributions or payments for the selected "participants", update their contribution/payment and, if another contribution, split evenly the remaining contribution between the non-edited "participants".

The following flow diagram provides more details about the code:

## What we found

During the exploration we found the following points that were to be discussed with the group before stop developing:

### Some of the workflows were identified

There was still some work on adding good code practices but the patterns that needed to be tackled in order to make the calculator started to emerge from this sketch. Also how to organize the data, the data sources, and the required functionalities.

### The code can still be improved to minimize redundancies and unrequired data gathering

Although the task was apparently simple, the fact was that there were more than a single way to solve it. There were more than one solution during the exploration that could head to the same result, some of them probably more efficient than others. The code is currently including several of those solutions, without a clear selection of a consistent solution that could lead to a cleaner code with smaller functionalities.

This was made even more evident after the code analysis using the flow diagrams, which appeared to be a useful tool to expose things like redundancies.

### The source of data should have come from Participants and/or Group Details

For the sketch of the calculator I hardcoded some data inputs, but some of the data is populated automatically from a JS object acting as a dataset at loading. The best source would be the @E_Asiedu data from participants or more likely the Group Details including @E_Asiedu Participants data. That source should update the cells (I used a HTML table for convenience but it can be any other kind of solution).

### A better, scalable way to identify cells had to be found

There are many ways to trace the cells in the table. It is about to find an optimal solution. Currently the identification is enough but not ideal. It requires more research. 

### Changes in the splits could have been loaded on a temporary file before the user decided to save the data

The calculator should not save data on the data file until the user is satisfied with the result, so all data is kept on the browser until the person is satisfied, after that the data should be saved on Local Storage or on the @E_Asiedu  data file.

## Where we left and we were heading to

The project was initially done in raw HTML-JS as I was not a React developer and there were members of the team without broad technical knowledge when installing packages. The intention was to explore with the team the feasibility of translating the findings into a cleaner React code and formalize a component that could have been inserted in the full workflow of the app, likely to appear under the Group Details section.

The reality is that this proof-of-concept could not be discussed by the team as planned, and could only be resumed during the last sprint. The development was finally translated into Typescript for overall consistency, but it was not converted into a React component so it could be inserted into the full project due to unavoidable delays and eventually closing deadlines.

This sketch was still an alternative to a simpler one proposed by @Tesfaye in his wireframe and the idea was to decide which route to follow after comparing the alternatives. But because we couldn't discuss the feasibility of this sketch and the motivation to go forward either with this proposal, the proposal by @Tesfaye, or any other proposal, the concretization of this sketch as part of the final product vision of the team was not certain.
