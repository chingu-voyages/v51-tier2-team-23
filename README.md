# Expenses Splitter app

**Overview**
As part of Voyage 51 our team are creating an Expenses Splitter app to allow friends, families and groups to easily split and track expenses.

**Features**
As a Tier 2 group, we have been given some key features to include and we think the following are must-haves:
  
  a. A split calculator

  b. Homepage with link to create new group.

  c. User can add participants quickly using just their name to an expense.

  d. The app will automatically caluclate certain fields based on data input by the user.

  There are more must haves and should haves in the App Feature Planning document here: [https://tier2team23.atlassian.net/l/cp/nMF1JU3s]

**To Do List**
Here are the features we want to add to our app in the future:

a. Exporting group data from the app in PDF or Excel format.

b. Create visuals on the spending trends of the group members.

Your project's `readme` is as important to success as your code. For
this reason you should put as much care into its creation and maintenance
as you would any other component of the application.

If you are unsure of what should go into the `readme` let this article,
written by an experienced Chingu, be your starting point -
[Keys to a well written README](https://tinyurl.com/yk3wubft).

And before we go there's "one more thing"! Once you decide what to include
in your `readme` feel free to replace the text we've provided here.
